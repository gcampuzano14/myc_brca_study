## Statistical report

### Descriptive stats

```{r dercriptive}
summary(df)
```

## Results

A total of `r n_total_patients` were analyzed and comprised `r n_tcga_patients` (`r per_tcga_patients`) patients from the TCGA data base and `r n_tcga_csaascaspatients` (`r per_tccascascascasga_patients` from Robertos database. A total `r n_brca1_mut` (`r per_brca1_mut`) had mutated BRCA1, `r n_brca2_mut` (`r per_brca2_mut`) had mutated BRCA1, and `r n_myc_amp` (`r per_myc_amp`) had amplified MYC.  

MYC amplification showed association with both BRAC1 and BRCA2 (OR: ), even afeter adjusting for age and somatic vs germline muation (Adjuted OR: ). However, MYC amplification was a poor predictor of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation (R2, sense?) as most MYC amplified cases were actually BRACA wild-type.
